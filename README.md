# Power BI

This repository contains a small collection of Power BI projects focused on
business-oriented data analysis and reporting.

Each project includes:

- the source dataset
- key DAX measures used in the model

The goal is to demonstrate data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design rather than
visual complexity.
